# Balls and Bins: A Load Balancing Simulation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for an empirical study of "balls and bins" allocation strategies. The notebook simulates and analyzes the performance gap of various allocation schemes, including 1-choice, 2-choice, (1+$\beta$)-choice, batched, and partial information strategies.

## 🔧 Setup

This project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `matplotlib`

Install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Balls_and_Bins.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or Google Colab).

2. Select "Run All" from the notebook menu.

This will execute all 50 trials for each simulation, generate all plots (.png files), and print the final data analysis tables.
